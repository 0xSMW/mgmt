# MANAGER.readme

## What is this?
This document enables you to get to quickly know me as a person and a leader. This is intended to clarify and accelerate our working relationship. It includes my principles, how I view my role, how I generally view your role, and general details about my day-to-day.

Taking on both Product and Design leadership responsibilities prompted the creation of this document, with the intended reading audience being both current and future team members. I highly recommend this exercise – articulating your principles, how you view your role, and your expectations of others – even if you never intend for someone else to read it.

This document **does not** include my specific expectations of your role, product strategy, or other plans. 

## Principles
I believe strongly in the value of having foundational principles for yourself and your work. A few of mine are the following:

**Continual learning:** Try to learn something new weekly. This curiosity and integrating learnings into your life/work pay dividends.  Use these learnings to continually improve (_Kaizen_).

**Dig deeper:** It is most easy to quickly make assumptions. Our brains are built this way. Inspect and reflect on your bias. Push aside bias and dig deeper to find the root cause. This is most easily represented by Toyota’s the 5 Whys.

**Feedback:** The best feedback is not easy to hear. Challenging feedback is what polishes personal growth. Even if you disagree with the comment, there is likely an insight to be found.

**Prototype first, discuss later:** Ideas are easy. It is often more difficult for them to make sense out of your head. Rather than discuss the ideas, work quickly to represent them via words, sketches, or prototypes. To steal from IDEO: a prototype is worth a thousand meetings.

**Own outcomes:** The process, analysis, and work is only the beginning. The outcome is everything. Own the outcomes to understand whether the inputs are right.

**Own your accountability:** You can control your actions and contributions, but there are many factors out of your control. Regardless of this, leaders take ownership and accountability, leveraging missteps or failures as learning opportunities.

**Seek understanding:** Work to understand the idea, person, or problem first. Understanding the nature of a situation removes frustration from your own misplaced expectations.

**Understand the nature of things:** Friction with reality occurs when you do not completely understand the nature of someone or something. Inspect and reflect.

**Write daily:** Writing appears easy, but it is actually quite difficult. Write fast, bad, and wrong. Then perfect it. The first draft is always shit. A narrative format clarifies ideas for the author and reader.

Some third-party principles that I enjoy are:
- Avoid rules (Netflix)
- Be Radically Open-Minded (Ray Dalio)
- Clarity is King (37Signals)
- Customer obsession (Amazon) / Focus on the user (Google) / Our customers are our investors (37Signals)
- Embrace Reality and Deal With It (Ray Dalio)
- Every frame matters (AirBnB)
- Let builders build (Uber)
- Meetings are toxic (37Signals)

## Product Principles for Freeletics
My career building digital products began in 2003. I believe I have an informed set of product principles based on my experience and learnings. In everything that we down should seek an understanding of the customer and the problem to build the simple thing first.

**Do the right thing** — Freeletics exists as a business and we all receive paychecks because Free Athletes believe in our mission and products enough to pay for it. In every decision, we consider what is best for our product and business- which is really asking, what is best for Free Athletes?

**Principled** — Free Athletes choose Freeletics because they believe in our product and values. Every touchpoint conveys and reinforces our brand values: dedication, development, honesty, respect, and holism.

**Coaching** —  The product experience is a vehicle for coaching. We communicate and explain recommendations, decisions, and adjustments.

**Discover the new** —  Free Athletes expect continual value in their subscription. We make it ridiculously easy to discover the new content added each week. 

**Behavior change** —  Habit change and formation is incredibly difficult. The default position is failure. Most will not succeed. We help form and reinforce positive habits while recognizing progress.

**Connect** —  Our community is one of our biggest strengths. We connect Free Athletes to challenge, inspire, and learn from each other.

**Connected** — The Freeletics app sits in a landscape of rapidly innovating fit-tech, which includes apps, phones, sensors, and wearables. Our customers expect their products to seamlessly work together through connected experiences. 

**Beyond the screen**  — Training (or cooking) is not a digital experience. We innovate toward multi-modal experiences such as audio or voice because Free Athletes expect us to continually innovate and make their experience better.

## My role at Freeletics
I came to Freeletics in December 2017. My decision to join Freeletics was primarily influenced by the desire to have my daily work positively improve the lives of people around the world. Before my arrival, I discussed with our CEO Daniel these three objectives:
- Lead and grow a world-class design team
- Leverage design for strategic topics
- Help make Freeletics a place where people want to work

With more responsibilities, some experience here at Freeletics, and the luxury of hindsight my objectives are now:
- Lead and grow a world-class team
- Ship a best-in-class product for our customers
- Set strategy and leverage my team to solve problems
- Provide context and clarity for anyone at Freeletics

As a set of examples, this means I will: hire and edit the team, remove obstacles to empower you, set and communicate product strategy across the company, improve processes, provide context to why a certain project or task is happening, help you grow your career and reach your goals, and clarify to department leaders the status or progress of a project (including any that you are working on). 

If I am doing something that from your perspective negatively impacts your work, your desire to work here, or I am telling you to do something without context, please let me know as soon as possible. I am extremely passionate about shipping and delivering for our customers, which can cause me to push for what I believe is best for them.

Additionally, if I am working on something that doesn’t seem to align with the objectives mentioned above (or our OKRs), please say something to me.

You are welcome to give me feedback on my work at any time. I believe feedback is a gift, especially regarding my work. Even if I do not agree with your perspective, I will do everything to understand it.

## Your role at Freeletics
I consider you a directly responsible individual (DRI). This concept is not explicitly spoken about at Freeletics (yet), but this is how I view everyone on my team. As a DRI, I expect you to make the best decisions and produce the best work possible within the scope of your role. To do this you will leverage your own skills and experience, as well as synthesize feedback from peers, leaders, me, and customers. Your meta-level goal is to create the first draft, gather feedback, and iterate as quickly as possible.

You don’t need to reach consensus or agreement on topics that you own. You are responsible for leveraging the data, insights, trends, or previous experience required to position your perspective as the correct path forward. This does not mean you get to be thoughtless. It also does not exempt you from explaining your thinking to others or people telling you that you are making a mistake. In fact, you should seek to understand alternate perspectives as an input to refining your own beliefs. 

You will find that operating in this fashion will build trust with peers and leaders as someone who is right a lot, especially when making hard choices – not because of your default opinion, but because of your willingness to understand and reposition your perspective based on the best-known insights. 

My responsibilities do not include your scope of responsibility. If I feel like you are making an ill-informed choice or applying poor judgment, I will tell you and attempt to persuade you. I will be incredibly direct if I feel like you are continually ignoring best practices, data, facts, or the macro perspective of Freeletics.

This is how I prefer leaders to treat me and how I have treated my teams over the years. If you don’t agree with something, I am happy to discuss and understand your perspective. 

## An average week
Each week we’ll have a team meeting with your peers for 60 minutes no matter what. We have a shared document which captures agenda topics for the entire team. This session may include news or announcements, but is not a forum for project status or progress. The exception is if an issue impacts all of your peers and this is the only time to update everyone.

In addition to team, Crew, or other meetings, we have a 1:1.  This meeting discusses topics of substance, not updates or status reports. If you notice a trend here, I am not optimizing meetings for updates, but rather discussion. I expect clear, frequent project communication so that this is not necessary. You can Slack me 24 hours a day, especially if there is something –an update or status change– that you think I should know. I like responding quickly, and I’ve got your back, but I tend to sleep from 22-6. Slack is the best channel to reach me.

Due to the current setup leading both design and product, the cadence and length of our 1:1s may vary. If you need anything – input, feedback, another perspective, anything – please find a slot on my calendar. If you cannot, just let me know and I will find time as soon as possible for us to meet.

I sometimes work a bit on the weekends, and this is my choice. I often use Saturday to reflect on the week and Sunday to prepare before the coming week. I do not expect that you are doing any work on the weekend. In fact, under German work law, you should not be working Sunday unless it is an emergency. I might Email/Slack you things or update calendar invites, but unless the communication reads “URGENT, EVERYTHING IS ON FIRE AND ONLY YOU CAN HELP,” it can always wait until work begins for you on Monday (or following work day). To date, I have never sent an urgent message on the weekend. I have however asked people questions on the weekend, and they answered, but I do not expect this.

If I am traveling or on vacation, I will give you notice of this. I often take small trips around long weekends or holidays, rather than multi-week vacations. New locations, food, and art keep me inspired and motivated. I usually do my best reflection and thinking on these trips. 

## My calendar 
My day is primarily composed of meetings that I attend or manage, and because of this, my calendar is visible to everyone. The majority of meetings are not private or confidential, and you are welcome to ask me questions about any topic. In the rare case that it is confidential, I will tell you. To date, this has not happened. I believe that open and transparent communication enables you and your work.

Generally, I work between the hours of 9am-7pm. On Mondays, I use 8-10am to prepare for the week. On Thursdays, there is a Freeletics Management blocker from 9am-12pm to focus on non-urgent, yet important topics.

## Meetings
I prefer meetings to have a clear agenda (or purpose) with everyone in attendance participating. I prefer reviewing supporting data or documents ahead of the meeting to elevate the level of conversation. I also prefer to start on time, whether I am running it or not. If I am unclear about a meeting's purpose or I think I lack essential information I will ask for clarification.

If you send a document a reasonable amount of time before a meeting, I will read it before the meeting and will have my questions at the ready. I prefer that you print a copy and give it to me – I use this focus and write notes.
If I haven’t read the material, I will tell you. 

If a meeting completes its intended purpose before it’s scheduled to end, let’s give the time back to everyone. If it’s clear the intended goal won’t be achieved in the allotted time, let’s stop the meeting before time is up and determine how to finish the meeting later.

## Bonus material _or_  About me
As mentioned above, I enjoy traveling. I love experiencing other cultures and building a better understanding of the world around us. My biggest hobby is [photography](http://photos.stephenwalker.co) and I recently purchased a drone. [Music](https://www.last.fm/user/aethelyon/library) and [cinema](https://letterboxd.com/aethelyon/films/diary/) are very inspiring to me. I quit my job in 2007 and learned audio production, producing several records in that year before returning to a tech startup in 2008. I enjoy reading non-fiction books or listening to podcasts exploring business and science.

I have great respect for people who are makers, as well people as who have a set of informed principles or values.

If you would like to better understand me, I have taken two personality quizzes. While I do not believe personality tests to be absolutely accurate, it may at least provide more perspective:

- Myers–Briggs: [ENTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/entj-strengths-and-weaknesses)
- Enneagram: Enthusiast / Achiever / Challenger – [you can view the specific details](https://www.dropbox.com/s/madaqrzl8k22wl9/WALKER-STEPHEN-RHETIResults.pdf?dl=0)

I have several of the weaknesses outlined as an ENTJ – especially being cold, rejecting roadblocks, or general impatience – and I actively work to improve them.

I also like [cat videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J---aiyznGQ).
